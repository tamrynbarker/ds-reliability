# CORE Skills - Data Science in Reliability Master Program

## About this program

Reliability analysis on in-service assets uses well-established methods to, for example, determine mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) estimates or identify failure modes. However, the data inputs to these calculations depend on how the raw data from maintenance repair records has been processed. Processes to extract and clean raw maintenance data are often ad hoc and performed differently by each engineer. As a result calculations for asset reliability measures and identification of historical events and failure modes are difficult to replicate. Currently, the process is manual, time-consuming and not scalable. 

The goal of this program is to **enable practicing reliablity engineers to use state of the art, open-source code-based tools, to interrogate their maintenance work order data and extract MTBF values and failure mode information**.

## Audience for this program

Target participants are involved in maintenance strategy development, day-to-day reliability analysis of existing plant, reliability improvement efforts, or maintenance management metrics.

Participants need to have 1) an understanding of how Weibull parameters are used in characerising failure behaviour (wear in, wear out and random) and for settting intervals in maintenance strategy development and 2) be able to understand simple characterisation of statistical distributions such as mean and variance. 

The material in this program can be applied to all asset classes: rotating equipment, mobile, linear, electrical and computing infrastructure so this is open to all engineering disciplines working in reliability engineering roles.

## Learning outcomes 

At the end of this program participants should be able to:

1. Estimate the parameters for a Weibull distribution on the life of an asset from maintenance work order data.
2. Determine key failure modes for an asset from maintenance work order data.
3. Describe the impact of pre-processing decisions on outputs.

## Getting access

**All program content is delivered using a virtual cloud server using Jupyter notebooks**. Examples of these notebooks are available on this Gitsite. These are comprised of text and Python code blocks. 

The code blocks are used to demonstrate the data processing and calculations. _There is no need to be able to code in Python yourself_. 

Participants in the program will use three browser windows, one accessing the Notebooks (for content), one for Menti (for anonymised Q&A) and one for Teams (to communicate with the presenters and other participants).

## About your presenters

This program has been developed by Tyler Bikaun and Melinda Hodkiewicz. It draws on Melinda's experience as a practicing maintenance engineer and lecturer in asset management, maintenance and reliability over the last 30 years, the tools and processes developed by Tyler during his PhD study as well as tools and processes developed by the Centre for Transforming Maintenance through Data Science and the NLP-TLP group at The University of Western Australia.
